JavaScript Homework

# I've completed both Assignment #1 and Assignment #2 (Bonus)

For grading, you can either grade both or just look at the UFO-level-2 folder.  The link I provided was for level 2 since it contains all of #1 and #2 (bonus).

NOTE:  I also coded a listener for the <enter> key.  So, you don't need to press the button each time you change the value of a field.  Just press the ENTER key.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
